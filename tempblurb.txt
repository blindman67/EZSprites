### EZSprites
The standard 2D canvas API provides the function `drawImage` to render an image onto the canvas. But I am so often asked "How do I rotate, or scale, fade, mirror.. " and so on. To do this you need to use the API transformation functions which for beginers can be very confusing. The resulting code that is often overly complicated and just hanging together. 

EZSprites aims to make drawing sprites simple. Just add the EZSprite.js file to your page, once you have the canvas context just hand it over to EZSprites and then draw the sprite.


    EZSprites.context.setCtx(context); // Set the context of the canvas you want to render to. Only need to do this once.
    EZSprites.images.draw(image, x, y, scale, rotation, alpha); // draws the image centered at x,y 
                                                            // scaled and rotated with alpha.

Or from a sprite sheet

    spriteSheetImage.sprites = [
        {x:0,y:0,w:16,h:16},
        {x:16,y:0,w:16,h:16},
        {x:32,y:0,w:16,h:16}
    ]; // define sprite locations
    EZSprites.sprites.draw(image, 0, x, y, scale, rotation, alpha); // draws sprite 0 centered at x,y 
                                                                    // scaled and rotated with alpha.
    EZSprites.sprites.draw(image, 2, x, y, scale, rotation, alpha); // draws sprite 2 centered at x,y 
                                                                    // scaled and rotated with alpha.

### Worlds, locals, FX and more

EZSprites covers all your sprite rendering needs. With Absolute, world, and local coordinate systems its easy to create pannable, zoomable worlds, populated with local coordinates systems. Each time you render a sprite you set up a local coordinates system, you can then draw in that local coordinate system. Rotate the characters and everything that is drawn local to him is rotated with him.

Draw the flea on the dog, on the boat, on the planet, rotating around the sun, moving around the galaxy. To move the flea forward `flea.x += flea.forwardSpeed;` and that is it you don't have to worry about what is going on around it.

Need a flickering fire. 
    
     EZSprites.FX.fire();  // set the fire FX 
     EZSprites.sprites.draw(fireSprites, Math.floor(timer % fireSpriteCount), x, y, 1, 0, Math.random());
